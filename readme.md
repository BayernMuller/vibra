# ðŸŽµ vibra

### What is vibra?
* vibra is a C++ music file recognition tool that uses an unofficial Shazam API.
* vibra analyzes music files and returns fingerprint data. It searches the Shazam database to identify the song.
* The Shazam algorithm is based on:
    * [An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf)
    * [How does Shazam work](https://www.cameronmacleod.com/blog/how-does-shazam-work)
* I referenced the Rust implementation of the Shazam client code from [SongRec](https://github.com/marin-m/SongRec/tree/master).
* I created this project for embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, which are challenging to set up with Python or Rust environments.

### Run vibra

##### Requirements

* vibra uses CMake for building. You need to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build vibra.
* vibra utilizes C++14 features. You need to install gcc-5 or a higher version.
* vibra depends on the following libraries:
